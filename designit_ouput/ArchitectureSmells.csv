Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
.,io.spring.initializr.generator.spring.configuration,Scattered Functionality,The tool detected the smell in this component because a set of two or more components realizes the same high-level architectural concern. Following components realize the same concern: io.spring.initializr.generator.test; io.spring.initializr.metadata; io.spring.initializr.generator.buildsystem.
.,<All packages>,Dense Structure, The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 8.67.
